## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Player Operations

```python
from app.services.api_client import FantasyAPIClient

client = FantasyAPIClient()

# List all quarterbacks
qbs = client.get_players_list_v2(position='QB', limit=50)

# Get specific player
player = client.get_player_by_id_v2(player_id)

# Get advanced stats (Next Gen Stats, EPA, CPOE)
stats = client.get_player_advanced_stats(player_id, season=2024)

# Get team history
history = client.get_player_team_history_v2(player_id)

# Performance vs specific defense
vs_defense = client.get_player_vs_defense_v2(player_id, defense_team_id)
```

### 2. Team Operations

```python
# List all 32 teams
teams = client.get_teams_list_v2()

# Get specific team details
team = client.get_team_by_id_v2(team_id)

# Get team roster
roster = client.get_team_roster_v2(team_id, season=2024)

# Get injury report
injuries = client.get_team_injuries_v2(team_id)

# Get schedule
schedule = client.get_team_schedule_detailed_v2(team_id, season=2024)
```

### 3. Game Operations

```python
# List games
games = client.get_games_v2(season=2024, week=5, limit=10)

# Get game details
game = client.get_game_by_id_v2(game_id)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Client Architecture

```python
class FantasyAPIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        # Auto-detects v2 from environment
        self.base_url = "https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v2"
        self.api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')  # Unlimited access key
        self.api_version = "v2"

    def _get_headers(self, include_api_key=True):
        # API key included by default for unlimited access
        if self.api_key:
            headers['X-API-Key'] = self.api_key
        return headers
```

### Error Handling

All methods include comprehensive error handling:
- HTTP timeouts (10s default)
- Status code validation
- JSON parsing errors
- Detailed logging
- Graceful fallbacks

### Data Structures

All responses follow v2 format:
```json
{
  "data": [ /* results */ ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

## 🚦 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 1: Backend Routes (Medium Priority)

Add backend routes to expose new methods:
- `GET /api/advanced/players` - List players with filters
- `GET /api/advanced/players/:id/history` - Player team history
- `GET /api/advanced/teams` - List all teams
- `GET /api/advanced/teams/:id` - Team details
- `GET /api/advanced/games/:id/stats` - Game team statistics

**File:** `app/routes/advanced_stats.py`
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Benefit:** Frontend can access all v2 features via REST API

### Phase 2: Frontend Components (Low Priority)

Add UI components for new data:
- Player list/filter view
- Team details card
- Player team history timeline
- Game statistics comparison

**Files:** `frontend/src/components/*`
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Benefit:** Users can explore all v2 data visually

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Future)

- Real-time game updates
- Advanced filtering/sorting
- Custom player comparisons
- AI chat interface
