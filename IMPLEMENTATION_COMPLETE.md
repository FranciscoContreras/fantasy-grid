## 🚀 How to Launch (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema
```bash
# If using Heroku
heroku pg:psql --app YOUR_APP_NAME < schema_v2_updates.sql

# If using local PostgreSQL
psql $DATABASE_URL < schema_v2_updates.sql
```

### Step 2: Start Backend
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Flask
python wsgi.py
```

You'll see: `INFO: FantasyAPIClient initialized with API v2`

### Step 3: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** Open `http://localhost:5173` and you're running with API v2!

## 🎓 Example API Usage

### Get Next Gen Stats
```python
from app.services.api_client import FantasyAPIClient

client = FantasyAPIClient()

# Get QB advanced stats
stats = client.get_player_advanced_stats('QB_ID', season=2024, week=5)
# Returns: {cpoe: 4.2, epa_per_play: 0.25, time_to_throw: 2.1, ...}
```

### Advanced Matchup Analysis
```python
from app.services.analyzer import PlayerAnalyzer

analyzer = PlayerAnalyzer()

# Calculate enhanced matchup
matchup = analyzer.calculate_advanced_matchup_score(
    player_position='WR',
    player_advanced_stats=player_nextgen,
    defense_advanced_stats=defense_advanced
)
# Returns: {score: 85, confidence: 'high', factors: [...]}
```

### Natural Language AI Query
```python
# Ask questions in plain English
result = client.ai_query_v2("Who has the best CPOE this season?")
# Returns Claude's answer with supporting data
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All v1 methods still work
- ✅ Can run v1 and v2 simultaneously
- ✅ Switch via `API_VERSION` environment variable

### Database
- ⏳ Schema created but not yet applied
- ⏳ Apply with: `psql $DATABASE_URL < schema_v2_updates.sql`
- ✅ Backward compatible - won't break existing data

### Advanced Stats Display
- Will show "No advanced stats available" initially
- Requires API v2 to return real data
- Graceful fallback ensures app still works

---

## 🎯 Deployment to Heroku

```bash
# 1. Set environment variable
heroku config:set API_VERSION=v2 --app YOUR_APP_NAME

# 2. Apply database schema
heroku pg:psql --app YOUR_APP_NAME < schema_v2_updates.sql

# 3. Deploy code
git add .
git commit -m "Implement Grid Iron Mind API v2 with Next Gen Stats"
git push heroku main

# 4. Verify
heroku logs --tail --app YOUR_APP_NAME
# Look for: "FantasyAPIClient initialized with API v2"
```
