# 🏈 Fantasy Grid: Landing Page & Start/Sit Strategy

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Focus:** Professional landing page + Core start/sit recommendation system
**Priority:** Make weekly lineup decisions the centerpiece of the app

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

> **"The key focus is to see which players you should start in fantasy to win the week"**

Your Fantasy Grid app should be the **#1 tool for weekly start/sit decisions**. Everything else supports this core mission.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Built

**Backend (100% Complete):**
- ✅ User authentication (JWT, register, login)
- ✅ Roster management (create, update, delete)
- ✅ Player management (add to roster, remove, update)
- ✅ Matchup creation and analysis
- ✅ Start/sit recommendations engine
- ✅ AI grading system
- ✅ Advanced stats integration (Next Gen Stats, EPA, CPOE)
- ✅ Weather impact analysis
- ✅ Defense rankings
- ✅ Injury tracking

**Frontend (85% Complete):**
- ✅ Authentication UI (login/register)
- ✅ Roster management
- ✅ Roster builder
- ✅ Player search
- ✅ Player analysis
- ✅ Matchup analysis
- ✅ Basic dashboard

### ❌ What's Missing

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **No landing page** - Currently shows auth form immediately
2. **Start/sit not prominent** - Buried in matchup analysis
3. **No quick weekly view** - Can't see "this week's lineup" at a glance
4. **No onboarding flow** - New users don't know what to do first
5. **Complex UX** - Too many steps to get recommendations

## 🎉 Final Thoughts

The core strength of Fantasy Grid is **helping users make better lineup decisions**. Everything else is secondary.

**The vision:**
> "Every Sunday morning, fantasy managers open Fantasy Grid, see their weekly lineup with clear START/BENCH recommendations, set their lineup in 60 seconds, and feel confident they made the right call."

**Make that experience:**
1. **Fast** - 3 minutes from signup to recommendations
2. **Clear** - Visual, color-coded, no ambiguity
3. **Confident** - Backed by data, grades, and confidence scores
4. **Habitual** - They come back every week

**Win the week, win the season.** 🏆
